Spectre CVE-2017-5753 PoC for Android/Linux/ARM64

Original Spectre PoC code is from appendix in its paper https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf

I've been testing alternative solutions to replace the X86 cache flush and timer instructions, not very stable. 

Now it become stable, thanks to methods from @lgeek https://github.com/lgeek/spec_poc_arm/blob/master/dump_sys_regs.c

a.out was compiled with Android NDK Standalone Toolchain:
/tmp/my-android-toolchain/bin/aarch64-linux-android-gcc source.c -pie -std=gnu99

or with a standard Debian AArch64 toolchain:
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc source.c -pie -std=gnu99 -lpthread
