Spectre CVE-2017-5753 PoC for Android/ARM64

Original Spectre PoC code is from appendix in its paper https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf

I've been testing alternative solutions to replace the X86 cache flush and timer instructions, not very stable. 

Now it become stable, thanks to methods from @lgeek https://github.com/lgeek/spec_poc_arm/blob/master/dump_sys_regs.c
